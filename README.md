# MonJeu

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) application that lets you play the classic game of "Pierre, Papier, Ciseaux" (Rock, Paper, Scissors) against an AI.

## Features

- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- Score tracking for both player and computer.
- Ability to reset the game and scores.

## Screen

-   **Game Screen:** This is the main screen where all the action happens! Choose your move and see if you can beat the computer.

## How to Play

1.  The game screen will load automatically when you start the app.
2.  Tap on "Pierre", "Papier", or "Ciseaux" to make your choice.
3.  The computer will randomly select its move.
4.  The result of the round (Victoire!, Défaite!, Égalité!) will be displayed.
5.  Scores are updated automatically.
6.  Tap "Jouer encore" to start a new round.
7.  Tap "Réinitialiser le Score" to reset both scores to zero and start fresh.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
